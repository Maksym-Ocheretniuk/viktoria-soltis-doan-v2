                  A Boy learns about the true meaning of friendship. When given the
                  option to force or allow a friendship to grow he chose
                  the right one. The Bird demonstrates that a big part of being friends is the freedom to choose it. A
                  great
                  life lesson
                  for all.

                  This is a beautifully illustrated story about a lonley young boy who
                  becones friends with a caged bird. By setting the
                  bird free, he learns a valuable lesson about true friendship. Reminded me of the old saying, "If you
                  love
                  something set
                  it free. If it comes back it's yours forever." Definitely recommend this children's book.

                  explain friendship. A
                  little
                  boy has a friend bird and can force it or let it free. He
                  made the right choice of course. The illustrations add to the story nicely.
