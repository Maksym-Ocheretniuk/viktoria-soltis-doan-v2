                  I bought this book for my children, we have all enjoyed reading it, in fact several times. This is a
                  good book for
                  children, however some adults could use the advice too.
                  The message is to believe in yourself, do what makes you feel happy, you are amazing in your own way.
                  The illustrations
                  are colorful and engaging!

                  the other chicks didn't have. Coco was shunned because he was different. In a rain
                  storm the colors came off and Coco had some time where he was like everyone else. His mother talked to
                  him about really
                  being himself. Coco had the occasion to be a hero, where his "real" colors showed through.
