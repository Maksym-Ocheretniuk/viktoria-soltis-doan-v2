            Little Chick Coco was born different from others. He had another appearance and other priorities. Because of
            this, he
            was rejected by all the residents of the farm. They were sure that their point of view and way of life were
            more correct, that's why Coco's habits seemed strange to them. None of them wanted to deal with him, which
            is why Coco was
            miserable and was dreaming of being like them.
          </p>
          <p class="book-page__description-text">
            But when his dream came true, he understood that it only made him unhappy.
          </p>
          <p class="book-page__description-text">
            The Chick understood that this is his life and he has a right to live it the way he wants. Coco started to
            like himself
            as he is. And when you love yourself, you become happy and you can do everything. Each of us is special and
            unique.
