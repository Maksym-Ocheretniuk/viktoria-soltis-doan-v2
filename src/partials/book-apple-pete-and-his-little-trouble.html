            Do you have any friends that underestimate you, say that you can't handle something? Or maybe, such thoughts
            appear in your mind. Which are like small worm “gnaws from the inside”.
          </p>
          <p class="book-page__description-text">
            This is a funny and a bit philosophical book to help you to understand how important it is to be
            yourself and believe in
            your strength. It is very important to trust yourself. Also, it is essential to understand who is
            next to you and give
            you some advice. Is this a friend or an enemy or a so-called frenemy?
          </p>
          <p class="book-page__description-text">
            This story is about a trustful apple Pete, who has a “friend” Worm. His bad advice constantly prevents
            Apple's
            decisions. Or, perhaps, these are the thoughts of Apple himself? “I can't”, “But, what if ...?”, “I don't
            have enough
            strength”, “It is too hard”. And although there are many obstacles on Apple’s path, he overcomes them
            successfully. And
            the most important thing is that he finally understands where all his little troubles come from. After all,
            everything
            could go much easier from the very beginning. Now he understands! His mind is pure from doubts and bad
            thoughts. He
            finally finds a friend and true inner freedom. He quits worrying and starts to act.
          </p>
