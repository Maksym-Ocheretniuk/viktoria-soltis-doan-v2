            Do you have any friends that underestimate you, say that you can't handle something? Or maybe, such thoughts
            appear in your mind. Which are like small worm “gnaws from the inside”.
          </p>
          <p class="book-page__description-text">
            This is a funny and a bit philosophical book to help you to understand how important it is to be
            yourself and believe in
            your strength. It is very important to trust yourself. Also, it is essential to understand who is
            next to you and give
            you some advice. Is this a friend or an enemy or a so-called frenemy?
          </p>
          <p class="book-page__description-text">
            This story is about a trustful apple Pete, who has a “friend” Worm. His bad advice constantly prevents
            Apple's
            decisions. Or, perhaps, these are the thoughts of Apple himself? “I can't”, “But, what if ...?”, “I don't
            have enough
            strength”, “It is too hard”. And although there are many obstacles on Apple’s path, he overcomes them
            successfully. And
            the most important thing is that he finally understands where all his little troubles come from. After all,
            everything
            could go much easier from the very beginning. Now he understands! His mind is pure from doubts and bad
            thoughts. He
            finally finds a friend and true inner freedom. He quits worrying and starts to act.
          </p>

                  A Boy learns about the true meaning of friendship. When given the
                  option to force or allow a friendship to grow he chose
                  the right one. The Bird demonstrates that a big part of being friends is the freedom to choose it. A
                  great
                  life lesson
                  for all.

                  This is a beautifully illustrated story about a lonley young boy who
                  becones friends with a caged bird. By setting the
                  bird free, he learns a valuable lesson about true friendship. Reminded me of the old saying, "If you
                  love
                  something set
                  it free. If it comes back it's yours forever." Definitely recommend this children's book.

                  explain friendship. A

                  made the right choice of course. The illustrations add to the story nicely.
