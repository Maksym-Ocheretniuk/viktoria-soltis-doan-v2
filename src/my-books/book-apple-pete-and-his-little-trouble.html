            Do you have any friends that underestimate you, say that you can't handle something? Or maybe, such thoughts
            appear in your mind. Which are like small worm “gnaws from the inside”.

          <p class="book-page__description-text">
            This is a funny and a bit philosophical book to help you to understand how important it is to be
            yourself and believe in
            your strength. It is very important to trust yourself. Also, it is essential to understand who is
            next to you and give
            you some advice.

                  What a lovely book! This gives inspiration to any person, young and old. Reminds you to stay who you
                  are but not to veer
                  off onto the wrong path. The message really moved me.
                  This book it's adorable! I haven't found a child who didn't like this book, it's so cute. Great story,
                  nice colorful
                  illustrations. I highly recommend this book!

                  A creative and cute story with lovely illustrations that will inspire children to believe in
                  themselves and to always
                  look for a solution to a problem, even when negativity tries to take over.
                  Highly recommended.

                  <span class="book-page__reviews-text-bold">lisa jacovsky: </span>This is an interesting book that
                  shows how harmful an anxiety type voice can be. An apple receives a worm that becomes a
                  voice of negativity. At first the apple is worried but then finds solutions to the issues he
                  encounters and ignores his
                  anxiety. A great way to teach kids to work on problems rather than let their anxiety take over.
